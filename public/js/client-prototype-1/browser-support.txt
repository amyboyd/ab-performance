store.js from https://github.com/marcuswestin/store.js doesn't support:
Firefox 1, 1.5
IE 6, 7
Opera 9, 10.10
Safari 2, 3
Chrome 4

DOMContentLoaded event is only supported in:
Firefox 1.5+
Safari 3+
Chrome 1+
Opera 9+

We need client.js to execute very fast so there is no flicker of unstyled content. Browsers considered
fast enough are:
Chrome 5+
Firefox 4+
Safari 4+
Opera 10.3+

========

CONCLUSION: We will support only these browsers in client.js:
Chrome 5+
Firefox 4+
Safari 4+
Opera 10.3+

Lower versions of the above, IE, and mobile browsers are not supported.
